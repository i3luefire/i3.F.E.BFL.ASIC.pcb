i3.F.E.BFL.ASIC.pcb
===================

Custom board designed by i3luefire of i3lue Fire Electronics Inc.

This is a PCB design for the BFL ASIC bitcoin mining chips. 
The design is far from finished but the aim is to be up and running by October. 
The current plan is to use water cooling and overclock the chips a significant amount to get the most out of them.
This board is going to be cutting out some of the extra hardware that BFL's reference design had in it without
having to modify the FW too much.
The power supplies should be overkill for the power needed for these chips.
The board is being designed to be 4 layers currently but that may be cut to 2 layers in the end if possible.
Either way it will be significantly cheaper to manufacture than the multi-layer board BFL released.
